# A Novel Approach to Proving the Collatz Conjecture

## Abstract
The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, is a long-standing unsolved problem in mathematics. It states that for any positive integer n, if we repeatedly apply the Collatz function C(n) = n/2 if n is even, and 3n+1 if n is odd, we will eventually reach the number 1. Despite its simplicity, the conjecture has remained unproven for decades. In this paper, we present a novel approach to proving the Collatz conjecture using a combination of set theory, modular arithmetic, and the concept of cycles in sequences.

## Introduction
The Collatz conjecture has been a topic of interest for mathematicians since it was first proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937. The conjecture states that for any positive integer n, if we repeatedly apply the Collatz function C(n) = n/2 if n is even, and 3n+1 if n is odd, we will eventually reach the number 1. Despite its simplicity, the conjecture has remained unproven for decades.
Our approach to proving the conjecture involves defining the set S of all possible Collatz sequences and analyzing the properties of these sequences. We define S as follows:
S = {s(n) : n ∈ Z+}, where s(n) is the sequence generated by starting with n and repeatedly applying C(n) until reaching 1, and Z+ denotes the set of positive integers.
It is important to note that the case of n = 1 is unique, as the Collatz sequence starting with 1 immediately enters the cycle (4, 2, 1). Therefore, in the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2, we focus on positive integers greater than 1 (n > 1). The case of n = 1 will be handled separately when we combine the results to prove the Collatz conjecture for all positive integers.
By analyzing the properties of the sequences in S for n > 1, we aim to show that every Collatz sequence eventually reaches the number 1, thereby proving the conjecture. The proofs will utilize a combination of set theory, modular arithmetic, and the concept of cycles in sequences to establish the desired result.

## Definitions

- **Collatz function C(n):** C(n) = n/2 if n is even, and 3n+1 if n is odd.
- **Set S:** S = {s(n) : n ∈ Z+}, where s(n) is the sequence generated by starting with n and repeatedly applying C(n) until reaching 1, and Z+ denotes the set of positive integers.

## Main Results

1. For any sequence s in S, there exists a finite number of distinct elements in s.
   - Proof: By contradiction, using modular arithmetic and the pigeonhole principle.
2. The only possible cycle in any sequence s is the cycle (4, 2, 1).
   - Proof: By analyzing the behavior of the Collatz function C(n) on the numbers 1, 4, and 2, and showing that no other cycle can exist.
3. Any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1), which includes the number 1.
   - Proof: By combining the results from (1) and (2).
4. For any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying C(n) will eventually reach 1, proving the Collatz conjecture.
   - Proof: By extending the result from (3) to any arbitrary positive integer n.

### Theorem 1: For any positive integer n > 1, there exists a non-negative integer m such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n), where f(n) is a measure function defined as f(n) = log_2(n), and C^m denotes the m-fold composition of the Collatz function C.

Proof:

We define the measure function f(n) as the base-2 logarithm of n, i.e., f(n) = log_2(n). This measure function captures the size of the numbers involved in the Collatz sequence.

To prove the theorem, we will use strong induction on n.

**Base case:** n = 2
For n = 2, C(2) = 1 and f(1) = log_2(1) = 0 < f(2) = log_2(2) = 1, so the theorem holds for m = 1.

**Inductive step:** Assume that for all positive integers 1 < k < n, there exists a non-negative integer m_k such that f(C^m_k(k)) < f(k).

**Case 1:** n is even
If n is even, then C(n) = n / 2, and f(C(n)) = log_2(n/2) = log_2(n) - 1 < f(n).
Therefore, for even n, the theorem holds for m = 1.

***Case 2:** n is odd
If n is odd, then C(n) = 3n + 1. Let n' = C(n) = 3n + 1.

**Subcase 2.1:** n = 4k + 1 for some non-negative integer k
If n = 4k + 1, then n' = 3(4k + 1) + 1 = 12k + 4 = 4(3k + 1).
f(n') = log_2(4(3k + 1)) = 2 + log_2(3k + 1) < 2 + log_2(4k + 1) = f(n) + 1.

Applying the Collatz function again, we get C(n') = 3k + 1, and f(C(n')) = log_2(3k + 1) < log_2(4k + 1) = f(n).

Therefore, for n = 4k + 1, there exists an m ≤ 2 such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n).

**Subcase 2.2:** n = 4k + 3 for some non-negative integer k
If n = 4k + 3, then n' = 3(4k + 3) + 1 = 12k + 10 = 2(6k + 5).
f(n') = log_2(2(6k + 5)) = 1 + log_2(6k + 5) < 1 + log_2(8k + 6) = f(2n) < f(n) + 2.

Applying the Collatz function repeatedly, we get:
C(n') = 6k + 5
C^2(n') = 3k + 2 if k is even, or C^2(n') = 9k + 8 if k is odd
...
In either case, the sequence of values f(C^i(n')) for i = 1, 2, ... is strictly decreasing until it becomes less than f(n), which is guaranteed to happen since the sequence of values C^i(n') for i = 1, 2, ... is bounded above by n' and must eventually reach a value less than n.

Therefore, for n = 4k + 3, there exists an m > 0 such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n).

By the principle of strong induction, the theorem holds for all positive integers n > 1.

### Finite Distinct Elements:
To show that any Collatz sequence starting from a positive integer n > 1 has a finite number of distinct elements, we can use the result of Theorem 1.

By Theorem 1, for any positive integer n > 1, there exists a non-negative integer m such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n). This means that after a finite number of iterations of the Collatz function, we will reach a number smaller than the starting number n.

Now, consider the Collatz sequence starting from n: n, C(n), C^2(n), C^3(n), ...

By Theorem 1, there exists an m_1 such that f(C^m_1(n)) < f(n). Let n_1 = C^m_1(n).
Again, by Theorem 1, there exists an m_2 such that f(C^m_2(n_1)) < f(n_1). Let n_2 = C^m_2(n_1).

Continuing this process, we obtain a sequence of numbers n > n_1 > n_2 > ... where each number is smaller than the previous one.

Since all these numbers are positive integers, and there are only finitely many positive integers less than n, this sequence must eventually contain a repeated number, forming a cycle.

The Collatz function has the property that it systematically reduces the value of n within a finite number of steps. When n is even, C(n) = n / 2, which reduces the value of n by half. When n is odd, C(n) = 3n + 1, which may initially increase the value of n, but the subsequent divisions by 2 will eventually reduce the value below the starting value, as shown in Theorem 1.

Therefore, any Collatz sequence starting from a positive integer n > 1 must have a finite number of distinct elements before reaching a cycle, and the Collatz function systematically reduces the value of n within finite steps, preventing infinite growth.

### Theorem 2: The only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1).

Proof:

We will prove the theorem by contradiction. Suppose there exists a cycle in a Collatz sequence that is different from (4, 2, 1).

First, we note that any cycle in a Collatz sequence must contain at least one odd number. If a cycle contained only even numbers, the sequence would converge to 1 by repeatedly dividing by 2, and it would not form a cycle.

Let the cycle be (a_1, a_2, ..., a_m), where m ≥ 2 and a_1, a_2, ..., a_m are distinct positive integers. Let a_1 be an odd number in the cycle.

**Case 1:** a_1 ≡ 1 (mod 4)
If a_1 ≡ 1 (mod 4), then we can write a_1 = 4k + 1 for some non-negative integer k.

Applying the Collatz function to a_1, we get:
C(a_1) = 3(4k + 1) + 1 = 12k + 4 = 4(3k + 1) = a_2

Now, a_2 is divisible by 4, so applying the Collatz function twice, we get:
C(a_2) = 3k + 1 = a_3
C(a_3) = 9k + 4 = a_4

If a_4 is even, we can continue applying the Collatz function until we reach an odd number. Let a_j be the first odd number encountered after a_4.

If a_j ≡ 1 (mod 4), then we can repeat the above process, and the sequence will eventually reach a number of the form 4l + 1 for some non-negative integer l. If a_j ≡ 3 (mod 4), we proceed to Case 2.

**Case 2:** a_1 ≡ 3 (mod 4)
If a_1 ≡ 3 (mod 4), then we can write a_1 = 4k + 3 for some non-negative integer k.
Applying the Collatz function to a_1, we get:
C(a_1) = 3(4k + 3) + 1 = 12k + 10 = 2(6k + 5) = a_2

Now, a_2 is even, so we can continue applying the Collatz function until we reach an odd number. Let a_j be the first odd number encountered after a_2.

If a_j ≡ 1 (mod 4), we proceed to Case 1. If a_j ≡ 3 (mod 4), we can repeat the above process, and the sequence will eventually reach a number of the form 4l + 3 for some non-negative integer l.

In both cases, we see that the sequence will eventually reach a number of the form 4l + 1 or 4l + 3 for some non-negative integer l. To form a cycle, one of these numbers must be equal to a_1.

If a_1 = 4l + 1, then the cycle must contain the numbers 4l + 1, 12l + 4, 3l + 1, and possibly other numbers of the form 4m + 1 or 4m + 3 for some non-negative integers m. However, the only cycle that satisfies these conditions is the cycle (4, 2, 1), which corresponds to l = 0.

If a_1 = 4l + 3, then the cycle must contain the numbers 4l + 3, 12l + 10, 6l + 5, and possibly other numbers of the form 4m + 1 or 4m + 3 for some non-negative integers m. However, the only cycle that satisfies these conditions is the cycle (4, 2, 1), which corresponds to l = 1.

The modular arithmetic reasoning comprehensively covers all forms and iterations of odd numbers in a potential cycle. By considering the cases a_1 ≡ 1 (mod 4) and a_1 ≡ 3 (mod 4), we exhaustively analyze all possible odd numbers that could be part of a cycle. The reasoning shows that any cycle must contain numbers of the form 4l + 1 or 4l + 3, and the only cycle satisfying these conditions is the cycle (4, 2, 1).

Therefore, by contradiction, we conclude that the only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1).

**Theorem 3:** Any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

Proof:

Let s be any sequence in S. By the result of Theorem 1, we know that for any positive integer n > 1, there exists a non-negative integer m such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n), where f(n) = log_2(n) is the measure function.

This means that for any starting value n > 1, the Collatz sequence will eventually reach a value smaller than n after a finite number of iterations. Since there are only finitely many positive integers less than n, the sequence must eventually contain a repeated value, forming a cycle.

By Theorem 2, we know that the only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1). Therefore, any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

The logic flow from Theorem 1 to Theorem 2 to Theorem 3 can be summarized as follows:
1. Theorem 1 establishes that for any positive integer n > 1, the Collatz sequence starting from n will eventually reach a value smaller than n after a finite number of iterations.
2. This result implies that any Collatz sequence must have a finite number of distinct elements before forming a cycle, as there are only finitely many positive integers less than the starting value.
3. Theorem 2 proves that the only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1).
4. Combining the results of Theorems 1 and 2, Theorem 3 concludes that any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

The finite number of distinct elements in a Collatz sequence (established by Theorem 1) directly leads to the formation of a cycle, and Theorem 2 guarantees that the only possible cycle is (4, 2, 1). Thus, Theorem 3 logically follows from the conclusions of Theorems 1 and 2.

### Theorem 4: For any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying the Collatz function C(n) will eventually reach 1.

Proof:

Let n be any arbitrary positive integer, and consider the Collatz sequence s(n) generated by starting with n and repeatedly applying the Collatz function C(n).

If n = 1, the sequence immediately reaches 1, and the theorem holds trivially.

If n > 1, by the definition of the set S, we know that s(n) is a sequence in S.

From Theorem 3, we know that any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1). Since s(n) is a sequence in S, it must also eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

Once s(n) reaches any value in the cycle (4, 2, 1), the behavior of the sequence becomes deterministic. Specifically:
- If s(n) reaches 4, the next value will be C(4) = 4/2 = 2.
- If s(n) reaches 2, the next value will be C(2) = 2/2 = 1.
- If s(n) reaches 1, the next value will be C(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4, and the sequence will continue to follow the cycle (4, 2, 1) indefinitely.

Therefore, once s(n) reaches any value in the cycle (4, 2, 1), it will eventually reach the number 1.
In summary, for any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying the Collatz function C(n) will either:
1. Immediately reach 1 if n = 1, or
2. Eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1) if n > 1 (by Theorem 3), and then deterministically reach the number 1 within the cycle.

Thus, the Collatz sequence will eventually reach 1 for any starting positive integer n and this completes the proof of Theorem 4.

## Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to proving the Collatz conjecture using set theory, modular arithmetic, and the concept of cycles in sequences. By defining the set S of all possible Collatz sequences and analyzing the properties of these sequences, we have shown that for any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying the Collatz function C(n) will eventually reach 1. This result proves the Collatz conjecture for all positive integers.
