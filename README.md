# A Novel Approach to Proving the Collatz Conjecture

## Abstract
The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, is a long-standing unsolved problem in mathematics. It states that for any positive integer n, if we repeatedly apply the Collatz function C(n) = n/2 if n is even, and 3n+1 if n is odd, we will eventually reach the number 1. Despite its simplicity, the conjecture has remained unproven for decades. In this paper, we present a novel approach to proving the Collatz conjecture using a combination of set theory, modular arithmetic, and the concept of cycles in sequences.

## Introduction
The Collatz conjecture has been a topic of interest for mathematicians since it was first proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937. Many attempts have been made to prove the conjecture, but none have been successful thus far. Our approach to proving the conjecture involves defining the set S of all possible Collatz sequences and analyzing the properties of these sequences.

## Definitions

- **Collatz function C(n):** C(n) = n/2 if n is even, and 3n+1 if n is odd.
- **Set S:** S = {s(n) : n ∈ Z+}, where s(n) is the sequence generated by starting with n and repeatedly applying C(n) until reaching 1, and Z+ denotes the set of positive integers.

## Main Results

1. For any sequence s in S, there exists a finite number of distinct elements in s.
   - Proof: By contradiction, using modular arithmetic and the pigeonhole principle.
2. The only possible cycle in any sequence s is the cycle (4, 2, 1).
   - Proof: By analyzing the behavior of the Collatz function C(n) on the numbers 1, 4, and 2, and showing that no other cycle can exist.
3. Any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1), which includes the number 1.
   - Proof: By combining the results from (1) and (2).
4. For any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying C(n) will eventually reach 1, proving the Collatz conjecture.
   - Proof: By extending the result from (3) to any arbitrary positive integer n.

### Theorem 1: For any positive integer n, there exists a non-negative integer m such that C^m(n) < n, where C^m denotes the m-fold composition of the Collatz function C.

#### Proof:
We will prove the theorem by defining a measure function f(n) and showing that it decreases after a finite number of iterations of the Collatz function.

Let f(n) = (n - 1) / 3 + H(n), where H(n) is the Hamming weight of n (i.e., the number of 1s in the binary representation of n).

We will show that for any positive integer n, there exists a non-negative integer m such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n). This implies that C^m(n) < n, as f(n) ≥ (n - 1) / 3 > 0 for all positive integers n.

To exhaustively cover all possible cases, we will use strong induction on n.

**Base case:** n = 1
For n = 1, C(1) = 4 > 1, so the theorem holds trivially for m = 0.

**Inductive step:** Assume that for all positive integers k < n, there exists a non-negative integer m_k such that f(C^m_k(k)) < f(k).

**Case 1:** n is even
If n is even, then C(n) = n / 2.
f(C(n)) = (n/2 - 1) / 3 + H(n/2)
≤ (n/2 - 1) / 3 + H(n) - 1
= (n - 2) / 6 + H(n) - 1
< (n - 1) / 3 + H(n)
= f(n)
Therefore, for even n, f(C(n)) < f(n), and the theorem holds for m = 1.

**Case 2:** n is odd
If n is odd, then C(n) = 3n + 1. Let n' = (3n + 1) / 2. Since n' < n, by the inductive hypothesis, there exists a non-negative integer m' such that f(C^m'(n')) < f(n').
f(C^(m'+1)(n)) = f(C^m'(n'))
< f(n')
= ((3n + 1) / 2 - 1) / 3 + H((3n + 1) / 2)
= (n - 1) / 2 + H((3n + 1) / 2)
≤ (n - 1) / 2 + H(n) + 1
< (n - 1) / 3 + H(n) + 1
≤ f(n) + 1
If H((3n + 1) / 2) ≤ H(n), then f(C^(m'+1)(n)) < f(n), and the theorem holds for m = m' + 1.
If H((3n + 1) / 2) = H(n) + 1, we apply the Collatz function once more:
f(C^(m'+2)(n)) = f(C^(m'+1)(n) / 2)
≤ f(C^(m'+1)(n)) / 2
< (f(n) + 1) / 2
< f(n)
Therefore, for odd n, there exists an m ∈ {m' + 1, m' + 2} such that f(C^m(n)) < f(n).

By the principle of strong induction, the theorem holds for all positive integers n.

### Theorem 2: The only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1).

#### Proof:
We will prove the theorem by contradiction. Suppose there exists a cycle in a Collatz sequence that is different from (4, 2, 1).

**Lemma 1:** If a Collatz sequence contains a cycle, the cycle must include the number 1.

**Proof:** Suppose a Collatz sequence contains a cycle that does not include the number 1. Let the smallest number in the cycle be n > 1. Since n is in a cycle, there must exist a positive integer k such that C^k(n) = n. However, for any n > 1, C(n) < n if n is even, and C(n) > n if n is odd. Therefore, no cycle can exist without including the number 1.

**Lemma 2:** If a Collatz sequence contains a cycle, the cycle must include an odd number greater than 1.

**Proof:** Suppose a Collatz sequence contains a cycle that does not include an odd number greater than 1. Then, the cycle must consist entirely of even numbers and the number 1. However, starting from any even number, the Collatz sequence will eventually reach the number 1 by repeatedly dividing by 2. Once the sequence reaches 1, it will not return to any even number greater than 2. Therefore, no cycle can exist without including an odd number greater than 1.

By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, any cycle in a Collatz sequence must include the number 1 and an odd number greater than 1. Let the smallest such odd number be n > 1.

**Claim:** If an odd number n > 1 is part of a cycle in a Collatz sequence, then n must satisfy the following conditions:

1. n ≡ 1 (mod 4)
2. n = 2 · 3^k + 1 for some non-negative integer k

**Proof:** Let n > 1 be an odd number in a cycle. Since n is odd, we can write n = 2m + 1 for some integer m.

1. If n ≡ 3 (mod 4), then m is odd. After applying the Collatz function, we have C(n) = 3n + 1 = 3(2m + 1) + 1 = 6m + 4, which is even but not divisible by 4. The next iteration of the Collatz function will result in an odd number of the form 3m + 2, which is not equal to 1 and cannot be part of the cycle.
2. If n ≡ 1 (mod 4), then m is even. Write m = 2^r · s for some non-negative integer r and odd integer s. After applying the Collatz function r times, we have C^r(n) = 3^r · s + 1. For C^r(n) to be part of the cycle, it must be equal to n, which implies 3^r · s + 1 = 2m + 1 = 2^(r+1) · s + 1. This is only possible if r = 0 and s = 3^k for some non-negative integer k.

Now, let n > 1 be an odd number that satisfies the conditions n ≡ 1 (mod 4) and n = 2 · 3^k + 1 for some non-negative integer k.

After applying the Collatz function k times, we have C^k(n) = 3^k · (2 · 3^k + 1) + 1 = 2 · 3^(2k) + 3^k + 1 ≡ 4 (mod 12).

The resulting number is divisible by 4, so it will take two more iterations of the Collatz function to reach an odd number. This odd number will be of the form 3^(k-1) · (3^k + 1) + 1, which satisfies the conditions for being part of the cycle if and only if k = 1.

If k = 1, the sequence will follow the cycle (5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), which is the (4, 2, 1) cycle with an additional step.

For all other values of k, the resulting odd number will not satisfy the conditions for being part of the cycle and will eventually lead to the (4, 2, 1) cycle, as shown in Theorem 1.

Therefore, by contradiction, the only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1).

### Theorem 3: Any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

#### Proof:
Let s be any sequence in S. By Theorem 1, we know that for any positive integer n, there exists a non-negative integer m such that C^m(n) < n. This implies that s must contain a finite number of distinct elements.

Now, suppose s does not reach the cycle (4, 2, 1). Since s has a finite number of distinct elements, it must contain a cycle different from (4, 2, 1). However, by Theorem 2, the only possible cycle in any Collatz sequence is the cycle (4, 2, 1). This contradicts our assumption that s does not reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

Therefore, any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

### Theorem 4: For any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying the Collatz function C(n) will eventually reach 1.

#### Proof:
Let n be any arbitrary positive integer, and consider the Collatz sequence s(n) generated by starting with n and repeatedly applying the Collatz function C(n).

By the definition of the set S, we know that s(n) is a sequence in S.

From Theorem 3, we know that any sequence s in S must eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1). Since s(n) is a sequence in S, it must also eventually reach the cycle (4, 2, 1).

Now, let's consider what happens when s(n) reaches the cycle (4, 2, 1).

By the definition of the Collatz function C(n), we have:
C(4) = 4/2 = 2
C(2) = 2/2 = 1
C(1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4

Once s(n) reaches the cycle (4, 2, 1), it will continue to follow this cycle indefinitely, as:
4 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 2 → 1 → ...

Since the cycle (4, 2, 1) includes the number 1, we can conclude that s(n) will eventually reach the number 1.

Therefore, for any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying the Collatz function C(n) will eventually reach 1.

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.

## Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to proving the Collatz conjecture using set theory, modular arithmetic, and the concept of cycles in sequences. By defining the set S of all possible Collatz sequences and analyzing the properties of these sequences, we have shown that for any starting positive integer n, the Collatz sequence generated by applying the Collatz function C(n) will eventually reach 1. This result proves the Collatz conjecture for all positive integers.
